# Suggestions

Since the Typescript conversion will attempt to be as faithful as
possible to the original Python implementation, any potential changes
that could me made are to be marked in comments. In adding comments,
the code will obviously be less faithful as they weren't there
originally, but they will be removed once they have been addressed
in the Python and Typescript versions at a later date.

**Except** this version will use camel case instead of snake case.

Below is a key identifying each of the suggestion types.

- `(Python???)` -
Python specific code that may not be needed for the Typescript conversion.

- `(Spelling???)` -
Possible spelling mistake.

- `(DocFix???)` -
Documentation error (generic).

- `(Inconsistent???)` -
Documentation or comments are inconsistent with the code.

- `(Done???)` -
Identifies a TODO that has already been done.
